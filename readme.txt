For this assignment I made a multiplcation table generator using bootstrap and javascript.
I used bootstrap for forms and javascript to take that data and create a table.  It supports
decimals and has error handling for special characters and letters.  Javascript uses an 
already existing table and replaces its table body as a way of dynamically regenerating the
table.
